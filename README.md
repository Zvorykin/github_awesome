# Github awesome

Simple pet project to take a look at fetching data using GraphQL API.

Ruby 2.7.1

As usual

```
bundle
yarn
rails db:create db:migrate
./bin/webpack-dev-server 

http://localhost:3000/
```

but also need to add ENV variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`, for example by creating .env file containing `GITHUB_TOKEN=123456789`
